# Maze

first download project

to also run test code download and import as gradle project

to run the search engine run MainWindow.java and follow instructions

MainWindow.java is located in main.java.mazes.gui

running MainWindo will open up a grid

options are availabe to change grid to Voroni 

,to remove a percentage of walls (can be customized in MainWindow), and to make a maze using Kruskal's

Kruskal and Dijkstra's algorithms are implemented in Graph.java 

KruskalMazeCarver.java uses these algorithms to choose which maze walls to remove

these files have tests written to ensure functionality

these pages use data structures that I've implemented

they are ArrayHeap, ChainedHashSet, DoubleLinkedList, ArrayDictionary, ChainedHashDictionary, ArrayDisjointSet, and Searcher

each data structure has tests written to ensure functionality
